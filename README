Winamp::Control
===============

	Winamp::Control is a perl module for controlling winamp/shoutcast (www.winamp.com) over the network.
	It requires the httpQ winamp-plugin written by Kosta Arvanitis (see prerequisites) installed on the
	computer playing the music (http gateway to controlling winamp). Perl clients doesn't need it,

	An example script to control winamp/shoutcast is included (winampctl).
