Winamp/Control version 0.01
===========================

Winamp::Control is a perl module for controlling winamp/shoutcast (www.winamp.com) over the network.
It requires the httpQ winamp-plugin written by Kosta Arvanitis (see prerequisites) installed on the
computer playing the music (http gateway to controlling winamp). Perl clients doesn't need it,
because the clients are communicating via http and just give the commands.

An example script to control winamp/shoutcast is included (winampctl).
