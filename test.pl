You will need the winamp-plugin "httpQ" (Written by Kosta Arvanitis) installed on the machine playing
the music via winamp/shoutcast. You may find it at:

	http://www.kostaa.com/winamp/

or otherwise search the plugin-section at

	http://www.winamp.com

After installation you have to activate httpQ through the winamp preferences dialog. In the
"Plug-ins/General Purpose" section, select httpQ and press the configure button at the bottom.

Install and run it before the this test, otherwise it will fail (not important).

TEST FAILED !

You should verify:

	1) Winamp was started.
	2) The httpQ-plugin was started (explicitly started httpQ with the 'start'-button or automatic).
	3) If you have entered the correct host and port.
